# HW4 - Reflection
## Design
1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

Creating storyboards for our project proved to be very helpful as it allowed us to better understand the different features and design methods that we wanted to implement. By illustrating the problem we chose and then showing how our project idea would help solve that problem enabled each team member to get a clear picture of how we are going to design the Discord bot, what features it will contain, and how it will function. 

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult aspect when thinking about the design methods of our project was figuring out which API to use. There are various weather APIs available on the web; some are free, some are not. They all display data in different ways. The team eventually decided to go with the OpenWeather API as it seemed to be the most beginner friendly and had plenty of features available for developers at no cost. There isn't much that we would have done differently. Our bot idea was simple, yet useful. In the future, we could definitely add more feautres to it like implementing a machine learning algorithm that learns over time the weather tolerance of each user as bot suggests different outfits of clothing. 

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I would definately want to trying storyboarding and prototyping in a future software development project. It can prove to be challenging when working with multiple people to fully grasp the design and functionality of a product. Each person might have their own ideas on how a product should look or function. Developing storyboard and prototypes helps keep every team member on the same page. 

## Implementation
1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

The Discord API, Google Maps Geocoding API, and OpenWeather API were all helpful in the implementation, testing, and integration of our bot project. Discord is an established platform that has a huge developer community. As such, setting up the bot and server was hassle free as the documentation was easy to understand and to the point. Google Maps API helped us convert a zipcode, which is what is input by the user, to GPS coordinate (longitude/latitude) which is what is understood by the OpenWeather API. Furthermore, the OpenWeather API was also a very easy to implement tool in our project as the documentation made it easy for us to fetch real-time weather data. 

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult part of implementation was figuring out the recommendation system. Since there are infinitely different combinations of weather conditions, it was quite difficult at first to try to organize the way that the bot would recommend different clothing options for the user. Ultimtely, the team did a bit of brainstorming and are pleased with the working product. 

3. What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I definately want to try to develop more Discord bots in the future. This was my first time interacting with Discord JS and after seeing how fun and easy it is, I would love to bring other ideas to live on the Discord platform. 

## Process
1. What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?

Using the project kanban board built into Github helped keep the team on task and allowed us to coordinate amongst ourselves who was going to tackle a specific part of the project. We also had a very organized process of code review where each team member would submit a pull request once the were done with their part and another team member would review the code before it gets metged onto the main branch. This allowed us to be organized and make consistant progress on the bot project. We also added a variety of Github issues based on the tasks we wanted to complete which we linked to the kanban board. 

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult is probably coordinating among our group who is going to tackle which part of the project from an early stage. When working with multiple members on a software project it tends to be challenging to do this since a lot of code depends on each other. However, as a group we came togehter frequently and put our best effort. 

3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I definately want to try the Github kanban board more in a future project. Not only does it help keep a team organized, but it makes coordination so much easier. There are many advanced features within Github like automation that I could leverage going forward. 

## Overall
Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.

Overall, all of the design, implementation, and sofware process methods mentioned above are really useful and they should all be used in any future sofware project. Software development can be quite tricky especially since each person usually has their own ideas and thoughts about how to implement something. However, using all of the aforementioned tools like storyboarding and Github issues can make the process so much easier and more fun!
