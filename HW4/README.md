# HW4 - Reflection
## Design
1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

Creating storyboards for our project proved to be very helpful as it allowed us to better understand the different features and design methods that we wanted to implement. By illustrating the problem we chose and then showing how our project idea would help solve that problem enabled each team member to get a clear picture of how we are going to design the Discord bot, what features it will contain, and how it will function. 

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult aspect when thinking about the design methods of our project was figuring out which API to use. There are various weather APIs available on the web; some are free, some are not. They all display data in different ways. The team eventually decided to go with the OpenWeather API as it seemed to be the most beginner friendly and had plenty of features available for developers at no cost. There isn't much that we would have done differently. Our bot idea was simple, yet useful. In the future, we could definitely add more feautres to it like implementing a machine learning algorithm that learns over time the weather tolerance of each user as bot suggests different outfits of clothing. 

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I would definately want to trying storyboarding and prototyping in a future software development project. It can prove to be challenging when working with multiple people to fully grasp the design and functionality of a product. Each person might have their own ideas on how a product should look or function. Developing storyboard and prototypes helps keep every team member on the same page. 

## Implementation
1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

3. What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

## Process
1. What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

## Overall
Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
